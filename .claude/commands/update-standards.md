# Update standards

IMPORTANT: Think ultra hard.

Here is a documentation for AgentOS standards: `https://buildermethods.com/agent-os/standards` . Your goal is to revisit current standards defined in agent-os/standards and generate new most relevant standards based on current project setup.
Remove those standards which are irrelevant for this project.

Before you start, read the `Gemfile` and get a context of the libraries used in this project and follow theirs best practices.
